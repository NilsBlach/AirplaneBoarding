(text between brackets to be removed)

> * Group Name:  PlaneBoarding
> * Group participants names: Nils Blach, Anton Schäfer 
> * Project Title: Airplane Boarding
> * Programming language: Python

## General Introduction
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)

# Reproducibility

Before reproducing our work, make sure you have pyhton3, numpy, and matplotlib installed. 
To run the light test, just run the python script light_test.py. It will simulate boarding of an Airbus A320-200 with 100 % load and 180 passengers, using the random seat assignment and the Steffen method. It will print the boarding times to the console
