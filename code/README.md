actor.py: Contains all the code for the actors that defines their behaviour etc.
aisle.py: Contains the class aisle, which stores the array and other information
compare_load.py: used for data collection to analyse affect of load
compare_methods_new.py: used for data collection for the two new planes
compare_methods_paper.py: used for data collection to compare our model with the model from the other paper
compartment.py: Contains the class compartment, which stores the position and size of a compartment
figures.py: used to create the figures in the paper
full_test.py: used to start the full reproducability test
full_test_graphics.py: used to generate the graphics from the data of the reproducability test
graphics.py: Contains the code for the animations 
light_test.py: Start light reproducability test
main.py: code to see the steffen simulation animated
measurements.py: code that was used to generate measruments, before we used parallelism to generate results. Only one method is needed for one test the rest is unused.
passenger_type.py: contains the class that stores the features of the actors
plane.py: class that stores all information about the plane (aisle compartements etc.)
seat.py: class to store seat information
seat_assignments.py: contains all the code to generate all the different seat_assignments that were used
simulation.py: Contains the main code to run a simulation and let the actors board the plane etc.
test_methods.txt: contains the input information for the seat assignments used in the paper


The data folder contains all the data that was generated, including graphs etc.
The img folder contains the images used for the animations
